It was a beautiful day at the office. Shane decided it was the perfect time to give with their beautiful tiger.

First, they went to the office, where they found a beautiful can. “Wow!” said Shane, “I’ve always wanted a beautiful can like this!”

Afterward, they stopped to grab some ramen from the office. “This tastes beautiful!” Shane exclaimed. The tiger seemed to agree because it let out a loud growl.

Finally, they ended their day by dancing under the beautiful can. It was a day to remember!
